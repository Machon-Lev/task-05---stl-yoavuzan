"# task-05---stl-yoavuzan" 
I chose Multimup because it allows quick input and deletion of data. It also allows double values ​​to be inserted if there are cities with the same name or in the same area. After performing two filters and deleting the cities we received as input, we have a fixed size of data. I used a vector and sorted it because the vector size is known in advance.
